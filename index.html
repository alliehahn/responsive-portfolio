            <p> You can call me Allison or Allie, whatever suits you best. My time is mainly consumed
                    by being a dog mom to my pup Sadie, going to a lot of baseball games, eating sushi, and doing embroidery (you can check that out <a href=https://www.instagram.com/threadache/>here.</a>)
            </p>
            <p> 
                I am a Southern California native but spent four years at Chico State in Northern California. I spent some time in Public Relations and Marketing where I was introduced to web development and made the decision to persue it.
